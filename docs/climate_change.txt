Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations are natural, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the main driver of climate change since the mid-20th century.

The primary cause of recent climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming.

Effects of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, and impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. Arctic ice is melting, and many species are facing extinction due to changing habitats.

Solutions to climate change include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency, protecting forests, and developing carbon capture technologies. Individual actions like reducing energy consumption and using sustainable transportation also help.
