Space exploration is the investigation of outer space through the use of astronomy and space technology. It began during the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union, leading to the famous Space Race.

The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. This was followed by the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, in 1961. The United States achieved the first moon landing with Apollo 11 in 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface.

Modern space exploration involves multiple space agencies including NASA, ESA, SpaceX, and others. Current missions include the Mars rovers, the International Space Station, and the James Webb Space Telescope, which is revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.

Future plans for space exploration include returning humans to the Moon through the Artemis program, sending crewed missions to Mars, and establishing permanent settlements on other planets. Private companies are also playing an increasing role in commercial space travel.
